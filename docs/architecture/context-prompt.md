# Real Estate Transaction Form System Context

## Project Overview
A comprehensive real estate transaction management system built with React and TypeScript, designed to streamline the document submission process for real estate transactions. The system handles different agent roles (Buyer's Agent, Listing Agent, and Dual Agent) with role-specific document requirements and validation.

## Key Components

### Form Structure
- Multi-step form with progressive validation
- Role-based document requirements
- Dynamic form sections based on transaction type
- Integrated document upload system with Docusign/Dotloop support

### Core Features
1. Role-specific workflows
2. Document compliance validation
3. Real-time form validation
4. Progress tracking
5. Auto-save functionality
6. Form reset capabilities
7. Airtable integration for data storage

### Document Requirements
Different document sets required for:
- Buyer's Agent (17 required documents)
- Listing Agent (12 required documents)
- Dual Agent (18 required documents)

All documents must be uploaded to either Docusign or Dotloop for compliance.

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Context API
- Form Handling: Custom hooks
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Data Storage: Airtable
- Document Processing: Docusign/Dotloop integration

### Key Workflows
1. Role Selection
   - Determines required documents
   - Sets commission structure
   - Configures validation rules

2. Document Management
   - Upload tracking
   - Compliance verification
   - Conditional requirements handling

3. Form Progression
   - Section-by-section completion
   - Validation at each step
   - Progress persistence

4. Submission Process
   - Final validation
   - Document completeness check
   - Airtable submission
   - Automatic form reset

## Integration Patterns

### Docusign Integration
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- Document template management
- Signature request workflow
- Status tracking and webhooks
- Bulk envelope processing

### Dotloop Integration
- API key authentication
- Profile and loop management
- Document version control
- Status synchronization
- Batch operations support

## Security & Compliance

### Data Security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure credential storage
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Audit logging

### Compliance Requirements
- RESPA compliance tracking
- Document retention policies
- E-signature compliance
- Data privacy regulations
- Audit trail maintenance
